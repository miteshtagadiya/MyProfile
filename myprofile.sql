The role of a mechanical engineer is to take a product from an idea to the marketplace. In order to accomplish this, a broad range of skills are needed. The mechanical engineer needs to acquire particular skills and knowledge. He/she needs to understand the forces and the thermal environment that a product, its parts, or its subsystems will encounter; to design them for functionality, aesthetics, and the ability to withstand the forces and the thermal environment they will be subjected to; and to determine the best way to manufacture them and ensure they will operate without failure.

After launching iPhone, Apple&#39;s shares were soaring. What&#39;s more, because of the works on the iPhone, launching the operating system Mac OS X v10.5 was postponed from June 11, until October 26.<br />\r\n			<br />\r\n			The innovative solution in the iPhone was to remove the traditional keyboard; instead, there is a touch screen supported by the Multi-Touch technology. No stylus is needed; everything is operated with the use of a finger or multiple fingers. An additional novelty is the display that turns off when brought near the ear (proximity sensor) and a 3.5 in display, with 320 x 480 pixels definition, that automatically adjust the screen to the device&#39;s orientation (vertical - horizontal). iPhone enables listening to music (MP3 files), watching videos in mpeg format and taking photos with a 2.0 megapixel camera. Similarly to iPods, songs and videos are downloaded directly from iTune Store. The iPhone enables wireless access to the Internet via Wi-Fi and surfing the World Wide Web pages via Safari browser.<br />\r\n			<br />\r\n			On June 28, a day before the launch, Steve Job announced that every full-time and part-time employees of Apple, working at least one year for the company, would get an iPhone for free. Devices will be distributed in July 2007 when the demand falls. The iPhone was launched on June 29, 2007 in two versions - 4GB flash memory for 499$ and 8GB flash memory for 599$. In addition, during the purchase of the device one has to conclude a two-year subscription contract with AT&amp;T. However, when the iPhone&#39;s SIM Lock security was unlocked, its price fell rapidly to 399$ for 8GB flash memory. Already a few days before the launch long queues were formed in front of Apple and AT&amp;T networks&#39; showrooms. Greg Packer was the first in a queue to a shop in New York; he had been waiting around 10 hours starting from Monday morning till Friday&#39;s evening. A modified version of operating system Mac OS X has been used in the iPhone.<br />\r\n			<br />\r\n			For the first two years iPhone will be available in the USA only in AT&amp;T Mobility network. Except for the USA, the Apple Inc. has concluded contracts with the following networks:<br />\r\n			* Germany: Deutsche Telekom<br />\r\n			* France: Orange<br />\r\n			* Great Britain: O2<br />\r\n			* Canada: Rogers (launch scheduled at January 18, 2008)<br />\r\n			<br />\r\n			Touch screen<br />\r\n			The iPhone has a 3.5 inches (8.9 cm) liquid crystal display (320 x 480 pixels) HVGA, acting as a touch screen that has been created for the use with one finger or multiple fingers. No stylus is needed nor can it be used, since the touch screen is not compatible with it. For the text input, a virtual keyboard appears on the touch screen, but it disappears when not used. Moreover, the iPhoone has a built-in spell-checker, predictive word capabilities and a dynamic dictionary that retains new words. The predictive words capabilities have been integrated with the keyboard so that the user does not have to be perfectly accurate when typing - unwitting touch of the edges of the nearby letters on the keyboard will be corrected when possible.<br />\r\n			<br />\r\n			Scrolling through the long lists works on the basis of &#39;a rotating wheel&#39;. Sliding a finger over the screen, imitating wheel spinning, spins the list that would whirl and then gradually stops.<br />\r\n			<br />\r\n			The photos and web pages magnification is an example of a multi-touch technology.
